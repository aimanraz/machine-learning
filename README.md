# [Fintech Case Studies : Directing Customers to Subscription Through App Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/aimanraz/fn-tech-logireg.git)
In present market, most of companies have a mobile presence which is an app. Some companies provide free products/services in their mobile apps in an attempt to transition customers to a paid/pro membership.

# [Fashion/Clothes Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://github.com/aimanraz/fsh-dtcn-cnn.git)
Before we start, I want to share with you guys what inspired me to do this project. Did you guys know that according to the [news](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/fast-fashion-industry-wants-cheap-disposable-trendy-clothes-but-it-comes-at-a-price/articleshow/77032023.cms) in July 2020, fashion and textile industries contribute 2.3 % to the world GDP which equivalent to 1.8 trillion USD!. Yeah, textile and fashion industries under the major spotlight. Next, I want to share with you some old videos from YouTube about [Amazon 'echo look'](https://youtu.be/9X_fP4pPWPw) which also inspired me to develop this model.

# [Breast Cancer Detection using Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/aimanraz/br-ccr-svm-svc.git)
This time we will use the SVM model to predict the tumors based on the extracted tumors features. Classify tumors malignant or benign based on several observations/features. Interested? Let's jump ahead.

# [Application Tool To Predict Resistance Spot Welding Weld Quality](https://github.com/aimanraz/rsw-deep-learning.git) 
* Developed an application tool that use deep learning to predict the weld quality of resistance spot welding. 
* The dataset that has been used for this project based on [this research paper.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261306908001301)
* This application tool consist of 6 tab which each tab have their own puposes.
* This project used only open-source software and packages.
* This application tool can only be used on windows platform.
* Some of the ANN model hyperparameter can be tuned, and some of it have been set to default.

# [Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/aimanraz/br-ccr-logireg.git)
Approximately 70% of data science problems involve classification and logistic regression is a common solution for binary problems. Logistic regression has many applications in data science, but in the world of healthcare, it can really drive life-changing action.

# More Machine Learning Project (coming soon!)
Currently making my fundamentals about ML more robust.
