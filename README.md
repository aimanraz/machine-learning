# [Breast Cancer Detection using Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/aimanraz/br-ccr-svm-svc.git)
This time we will used SVM model to predict the tumors based on given output. Classify tumors malignant or benign based on several observation/features. Interested? lets jump ahead.

# [Application Tool To Predict Resistance Spot Welding Weld Quality](https://github.com/aimanraz/rsw-deep-learning.git) 
* Developed an application tool that use deep learning to predict the weld quality of resistance spot welding. 
* The dataset that has been used for this project based on [this research paper.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261306908001301)
* This application tool consist of 6 tab which each tab have their own puposes.
* This project used only open-source software and packages.
* This application tool can only be used on windows platform.
* Some of the ANN model hyperparameter can be tuned, and some of it have been set to default.
* This project used supervised learning mechanism.

# [Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/aimanraz/br-ccr-logireg.git)
Approximately 70% of data science problems involve classification and logistic regression is a common solution for binary problems. Logistic regression has many applications in data science, but in the world of healthcare, it can really drive life-changing action.

# More Machine Learning Project (coming soon!)
Currently making my fundamentals about ML more robust.
